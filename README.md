### Hi there 🙋

I’m an engineer and biomedical researcher. My research was focused on studying cellular mechanisms (such as mitochondrial function and oxidative stress) implicated in the development of diabetes and its related cardiovascular complications. During this period, I learned many important lessons for becoming a data scientist.

    <summary><h3> 🏄 My data science journey</h4></summary>
    <p> While I was working on my PhD research, I really enjoyed analyzing the data from my experiments, understanding the math behind the statistical test I was using, trying to see patterns, making hypotheses, and finally telling an interesting data-based story.
    I started to teach myself R with the idea of analyzing my data faster and making my work more efficient. In the meantime, I had the opportunity to work on a bioinformatics project where I met people enthusiastic about coding and statistics, which inspired me.
    At this point, I was very curious about machine learning and all the potential of these informatic tools in solving real-world problems, so I decided to enroll in a Data Science Bootcamp.
    That’s how I started my path into data science, and I’m happy to have made that decision.</p>

### 💼 My Projects

#### 1. Biomarkers to predict the development of type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes involves many metabolic alterations beyond high glucose levels. It could be helpful for physicians to know which patients are more likely to develop diabetes. With this in mind, we examined the metabolic profile of patients at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes; this profile consisted of measurements of 250 metabolite concentrations and 780 gene expressions.
Because insulin resistance appears years before developing diabetes, first we divided the patients into tertiles based on their insulin resistance levels, with those in the lowest tertile exhibiting less resistance and those in the highest tertile having greater resistance. 
<br/>
<br>

We found that the patients in the highest tertile had a higher serum monounsaturated fatty acid ratio to total fatty acids and higher Glycoprotein acetyl (an inflammation marker), but less glycine (an amino acid) and acetate (a short-chain fatty acid), compared to those patients with less insulin resistance.
